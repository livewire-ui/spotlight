## About LivewireUI Spotlight

LivewireUI Spotlight is a Livewire component that provides Spotlight/Alfred-like functionality to your Laravel
application. <a href="https://twitter.com/Philo01/status/1380135839263559680?s=20">View demo video</a>.

## Installation

To get started, require the package via Composer:

```
composer require livewire-ui/spotlight
```

## Livewire directive

Add the Livewire directive `@livewire('livewire-ui-spotlight')`:

```html

<html>
<body>
<!-- content -->

@livewire('livewire-ui-spotlight')
</body>
</html>
```

## Alpine
Spotlight requires [Alpine](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine). You can use the official CDN to quickly include Alpine:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.x.x/dist/alpine.min.js" defer></script>
```

## Opening Spotlight

To open the Spotlight input bar you can use one of the following shortcuts:

- CTRL + K
- CMD + K
- CTRL + /
- CMD + /

You can customize the keybindings in the configuration file (see below). It's also possible to toggle Spotlight from any other Livewire component or via Javascript.

In any Livewire component you can use the `dispatchBrowserEvent` helper.
```php
$this->dispatchBrowserEvent('toggle-spotlight');
```

You can also use the `$dispatch` helper from Alpine to trigger the same browser event from your markup.
```html
<button @click="$dispatch('toggle-spotlight')">Toggle Spotlight</button>
```

## Creating your first Spotlight command

You can create your first Spotlight command by creating a new class and have it
extend `LivewireUI\Spotlight\SpotlightCommand`. Start by defining a `$name` and `$description` for your command. The
name and description will be visible when searching through commands.

To help you get started you can use the `php artisan make:spotlight <command-name>` command.

```php
<?php

namespace LivewireUI\Spotlight\Commands;

use LivewireUI\Spotlight\SpotlightCommand;

class Logout extends SpotlightCommand
{
    protected string $name = 'Logout';

    protected string $description = 'Logout out of your account';

}
```

The `execute` method is called when a command is chosen, and the command has no dependencies. Let's for example take a
look at the `Logout` command `execute` method:

```php
<?php

namespace LivewireUI\Spotlight\Commands;

use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\StatefulGuard;
use LivewireUI\Spotlight\Spotlight;
use LivewireUI\Spotlight\SpotlightCommand;

class Logout extends SpotlightCommand
{
    protected string $name = 'Logout';

    protected string $description = 'Logout out of your account';

    public function execute(Spotlight $spotlight, StatefulGuard $guard): void
    {
        $guard->logout();
        $spotlight->redirect('/');
    }
}
```

As you can see, you can type-hint your dependencies and have them resolved by Laravel. If you
type-hint `Spotlight $spotlight`, you will get access to the Livewire Spotlight component. This gives you access to all
the Livewire helpers, so you can redirect users, emit events, you name it.

## How to define command dependencies

In some cases your command might require dependencies. Let's say we want to create a new user and add it to a specific
team. In this case we would need to define a team dependency. To define any dependencies, add a new method to your
command and name the method `dependencies`.

You can use the `SpotlightCommandDependencies::collection()` method to create a new collection of dependencies. Call
the `add` method to register a new dependency. You can add as many of dependencies as you like. The user input prompt
follows the order in which you add the commands.

```php
SpotlightCommandDependencies::collection()
    ->add(SpotlightCommandDependency::make('team')->setPlaceholder('For which team do you want to create a user?'))
    ->add(SpotlightCommandDependency::make('foobar')->setPlaceholder('Input from user')->setType(SpotlightCommandDependency::INPUT));
```

For every dependency, Spotlight will check if a `search{dependency-name}` method exists on the command. This method
provides the search query given by the user. For example, to search for our team dependency:

```php
public function searchTeam($query)
{
    return Team::where('name', 'like', "%$query%")
        ->get()
        ->map(function(Team $team) {
            return new SpotlightSearchResult(
                $team->id,
                $team->name,
                sprintf('Create license for %s', $team->name)
            );
        });
}
```

Spotlight expects a collection of `SpotlightSearchResult` objects. The `SpotlightSearchResult` object consists out of
the result identifier, name and description.

Every dependency will have access to the already defined dependencies. So in the example below, you can see
that `searchFoobar` has access to the `Team the user has chosen. This allows for scoped dependency searching.

```php
use LivewireUI\Spotlight\Spotlight;
use LivewireUI\Spotlight\SpotlightCommand;
use LivewireUI\Spotlight\SpotlightCommandDependencies;
use LivewireUI\Spotlight\SpotlightCommandDependency;
use LivewireUI\Spotlight\SpotlightSearchResult;

class CreateUser extends SpotlightCommand
{
    protected string $name = 'Create user';

    protected string $description = 'Create new team user';

    public function dependencies(): ?SpotlightCommandDependencies
    {
        return SpotlightCommandDependencies::collection()
            ->add(SpotlightCommandDependency::make('team')->setPlaceholder('For which team do you want to create a user?'))
            ->add(SpotlightCommandDependency::make('name')->setPlaceholder('How do you want to name this user?')->setType(SpotlightCommandDependency::INPUT));
    }

    public function searchTeam($query)
    {
        return Team::where('name', 'like', "%$query%")
            ->get()
            ->map(function(Team $team) {
                return new SpotlightSearchResult(
                    $team->id,
                    $team->name,
                    sprintf('Create user for %s', $team->name)
                );
            });
    }


    public function execute(Spotlight $spotlight, Team $team, string $name)
    {
        $spotlight->emit('openModal', 'user-create', ['team' => $team->id, 'name' => $name]);
    }

}
```

## Register commands

You can register commands by adding these to the `livewire-ui-spotlight.php` config file:

```php
<?php

return [
    'placeholder' => 'What do you want to do?',
    'commands' => [
        \App\SpotlightCommands\CreateUser::class
    ]
];
```

It's also possible to register commands via one of your service providers:

```php
use \App\SpotlightCommands\CreateUser;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        Spotlight::registerCommand(CreateUser::class);

        // You can also register commands conditionally
        Spotlight::registerCommandIf(true, CreateUser::class);
        Spotlight::registerCommandUnless(false, CreateUser::class);
    }

}
```

Alternatively, you can also conditionally show or hide a command from the command itself. (Note: you will still need to register your command in your config file or in a service provider.) Add the `shouldBeShown` method to your command and add any logic to resolve if the command should be shown. Dependencies are resolved from the container, so you can for example verify if the currently authenticated user has the required permissions to access given command:

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use LivewireUI\Spotlight\Spotlight;
use LivewireUI\Spotlight\SpotlightCommand;

class CreateUser extends SpotlightCommand
{
    protected string $name = 'Create user';

    protected string $description = 'Create new team user';

    public function execute(Spotlight $spotlight)
    {
        $spotlight->emit('openModal', 'user-create');
    }

    public function shouldBeShown(Request $request): bool
    {
        return $request->user()->can('create user');
    }
}
```


## Configuration
You can customize the placeholder for Spotlight via the `livewire-ui-spotlight.php` config file. This includes some additional options like including CSS if you don't use TailwindCSS for your application. To publish the config run the vendor:publish command:
```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=livewire-ui-spotlight-config
```

```php
<?php

return [

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Shortcuts
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Define which shortcuts will activate Spotlight CTRL / CMD + key
    | The default is CTRL/CMD + K or CTRL/CMD + /
    |
    */

    'shortcuts' => [
        'k',
        'slash',
    ],

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Placeholder
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Define the text you want to show by default when Spotlight is enabled
    |
    */

    'placeholder' => 'What do you want to do?',

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Placeholder
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Define which commands you want to make available in Spotlight.
    | Alternatively, you can also register commands in your AppServiceProvider
    | with the Spotlight::registerCommand(Logout::class); method.
    |
    */

    'commands' => [
        \LivewireUI\Spotlight\Commands\Logout::class
    ],

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Include CSS
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Spotlight uses TailwindCSS, if you don't use TailwindCSS you will need
    | to set this parameter to true. This includes the modern-normalize css.
    |
    */
    'include_css' => false,
    
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Include JS
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Spotlight will inject the required Javascript in your blade template.
    | If you want to bundle the required Javascript you can set this to false
    | and add `require('vendor/livewire-ui/spotlight/resources/js/spotlight');`
    | to your script bundler like webpack.
    |
    */
    'include_js' => true,
];
